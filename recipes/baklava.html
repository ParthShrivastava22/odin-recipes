    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dough</strong> Make your own phyllo pastry dough or buy frozen
        phyllo dough at the store.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Nuts</strong> Chopped walnuts, pistachios, or a mixture of both
        are traditionally used. Hazelnuts and/or pecans would also work.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Butter</strong> Not only does melted butter add richness and
        flavor, it keeps the phyllo sheets moist and soft. It also helps the
        sheets stay together.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cinnamon</strong> Cinnamon is responsible for baklava's
        signature warmth.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</strong> A sweet syrup — made
        from water, sugar, vanilla extract, and honey — is poured over the baked
        baklava layers, bringing the delicious dessert together.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees
        C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.
      </li>

      <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li>

      <li>
        Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo
        with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two
        sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly with a pastry brush. Repeat
        until you have 8 sheets layered.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets
        of dough, melted butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should
        be about 6 to 8 sheets deep.
      </li>

      <li>
        Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the
        bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts.
        Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is
        melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let
        cool.
      </li>

      <li>
        Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it
        gets soggy if it is wrapped up.
      </li>

      <li>Enjoy!</li>
